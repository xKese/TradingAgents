Runs in the foreground. SIGINT/SIGTERM triggers graceful shutdown:
scheduler drains in-flight jobs, journal closes cleanly. Exit codes:

- 2: reconciliation-halted shutdown (journal has inconsistency events)
- 3: startup-halted — broker unreachable while building/reconciling
     (journal has broker_unreachable + startup_halted events)
- 4: live-flip ritual refused — first robinhood start without a TTY, or

Every session brackets itself with service_started / service_stopping

        vet (whole queue) -> drain (research_drain_nightly_cap names)
            -> vet the drain's new buys -> drain the next chunk -> ...

    Vetting runs FIRST so confirmed memos become tradeable nightly instead
    of waiting for the drain backlog to clear (a drain-first order starved
    vetting for days on the first backlog, 2026-07-11), and the loop vets
    each drain chunk's buys in the SAME window when time remains. Weekday

    weekend ticks extend to Monday HH:00 so the whole backlog clears before
    the trading week starts (see _overnight_deadline). One aggregated
    research_drain_run and research_vetting_run event per tick.
    Scheduler-safe: a drain failure records research_drain_error, a vetting
    failure records research_vetting_error (see _research_vetting_stage)
    and disables further vet iterations that night; neither raises.

    The job fires every 30 minutes (see _start_full_scheduler) so
    `ops research resume` picks work back up quickly; fires while paused or
    outside the window return instantly and touch nothing. Re-firing is
    idempotent/safe: the 3-day screen-due check plus the two queue states
    mean a second run same night either finds both queues empty (no-op,
    skipping ds4 entirely; the zero bookkeeping event records once per day)
    or correctly resumes whatever is pending. A fire that lands while a
    previous one still runs is skipped by the job's max_instances=1.
