"""Graph vetting of brain-authored memos (funnel stage 2).

The brain researches; the graph decides. Each pending_vetting memo (a
brain-buy by construction) is distilled into a deterministic brief,
injected into the multi-agent graph as ``research_memo_context``, and
adjudicated from the graph's NATIVE 5-tier rating — no extra LLM call and
no agent-prompt change decide the verdict:

    Buy        -> confirm, conviction high
    Overweight -> confirm, conviction medium
    anything else (Hold/Underweight/Sell/unparseable) -> reject

The mapping lives here, in code — no agent ever learns the
starter/medium/high taxonomy. One additional bounded structured call
extracts machine-checkable falsifiers from the risk debate; each candidate
must pass the same mechanical validity gate brain falsifiers face
(metric+operator+threshold), so the debate can only ADD monitorable exit
conditions. Extraction is additive: its failure never blocks a confirm and
never stores garbage.

Mirrors ops/research/drain.py's deadline/shutdown-boxed loop: stop
conditions are checked BEFORE each memo so a graph run in flight always
finishes; a per-memo failure leaves the memo pending_vetting (retried next
night) and never raises out of the loop.
