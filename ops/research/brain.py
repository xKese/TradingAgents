"""The research brain: pending screen hit -> validated structured memo.

Two-stage design for small context windows (spec Phase B):

  Stage 1 (evidence): one bounded structured-output call per filing section;
  every item must cite the section it came from; uncited/unresolvable items
  are stripped MECHANICALLY (resolve_evidence), not by prompt hope.

  Stage 2 (thesis): bear-case-first pass (why is it cheap — a specific,
  named reason), then memo emission through bind_structured into MemoDraft;
  code assembles the Memo and validate_memo gates storage. One retry with
  the validation errors fed back, then the hit is marked failed.

Deliberately a deterministic pipeline, NOT an agentic tool loop: the LLM only
ever answers bounded structured-output prompts and Python decides what gets
read. This is a leaner, memo-native design — NOT a workaround for weak models.
ds4 runs the full multi-agent tool loop fine (measured); the brain is kept
separate because it is faster, cheaper, and emits a validated memo directly.
See docs/research_pipelines.md for the head-to-head evidence and why the
momentum graph and this brain are two producers on one shared spine.
