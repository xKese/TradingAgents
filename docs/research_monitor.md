# Research Monitor Runbook (Phase C — the loop)

Phase C of docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-06-finish-research-system-design.md.
Open memos are watched mechanically; humans get exceptions. No LLM runs in
the monitor — escalations queue re-research hits for `ops research run`.

## What runs when

| job | where | when | what |
|---|---|---|---|
| research_monitor | ops daemon (APScheduler) | 16:20 ET mon-fri | falsifiers, drawdown, catalysts, resolution-due |
| screen | launchd com.tradingagents.screen | Sat 10:00 | fills the pending queue; auto write-off of delisted baseline names |
| research run | launchd com.tradingagents.research | Sat 12:00 | drains the pending queue into memos |

Manual: `ops research monitor` (safe anywhere; empty stores are a no-op).
Running it manually in the morning journals the research_monitor_run
summary event for that day, so the daemon's own 16:20 ET pass sees today
already covered and silently skips it — falsifiers are not re-evaluated
against the day's close.

## What gets pushed

| event | urgency | trigger |
|---|---|---|
| falsifier_tripped | high | a machine-checkable falsifier held for its consecutive_periods |
| research_escalation | high | falsifier trip or drawdown <= -30% queued a re-research hit |
| resolution_due | normal | expected_holding_months elapsed (memo exit checklist in the body) |
| catalyst_due | normal | a hard-dated event-sleeve catalyst date passed |

Re-notification is deduped per memo/falsifier over a 7-day window (journal
count_events — no side state). Escalations dedupe naturally: a symbol with a
hit already pending is not re-queued. A drawdown or tripped falsifier on a
memo that stays open just re-escalates on that weekly cadence (high push)
and burns a research slot each Saturday — the loop stops only once the
operator resolves the memo.

## Falsifier metrics evaluable today

drawdown_from_cost_pct (split-era-corrected vs entry_price_ref),
gross_margin_pct, revenue_yoy_pct, net_debt_to_ebitda. Anything else is
"unevaluable" — counted in the research_monitor_run summary event, never a
silent pass. consecutive_periods = trading days for price metrics, fiscal
years for fundamental ones.

## Requirements in the daemon environment

Fundamental falsifier checks need SEC_EDGAR_USER_AGENT in the ops daemon
plist env (re-render gotcha: install-service resets the env block — re-merge
creds per RUNBOOK). Without it, price checks still run; fundamental checks
degrade to unevaluable with a note in the run summary.

## Delisted baseline names

Each weekly screen probes every held baseline position once; a quote failure
journals baseline_quote_failure. Three consecutive failing runs write the
position off at the last buy-fill price (baseline_auto_writeoff, surfaced in
the screen's --notify summary). Manual override remains:
`ops research write-off SYMBOL --price P`.

## Inspecting

Monitor events (falsifier_tripped, research_escalation, resolution_due,
catalyst_due) live in the ops journal:

    sqlite3 ${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/tradingagents/ops_journal.sqlite \
      "SELECT at, kind, payload FROM events WHERE kind IN ('falsifier_tripped', 'research_escalation', 'resolution_due', 'catalyst_due') ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 20"

Delisted-baseline events (baseline_quote_failure, baseline_auto_writeoff)
are journaled into the separate baseline journal (ops/config.py
_default_baseline_journal_path), not the ops journal above:

    sqlite3 ${XDG_STATE_HOME:-~/.local/state}/tradingagents/baseline_journal.sqlite \
      "SELECT at, kind, payload FROM events WHERE kind IN ('baseline_quote_failure', 'baseline_auto_writeoff') ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 20"
