"""Pacing + retry + failure counting for batch yfinance I/O.

On 2026-07-06 a transient Yahoo degradation (rate-limiting under ~500 rapid
calls at the open) made yfinance raise KeyError for every symbol; the
per-name skip handlers correctly ate the errors and the day's universe was
silently empty. This module is the single choke point that fixes all three
aspects: a process-global minimum interval keeps sweeps under Yahoo's
rate limits, transient failures retry with backoff, and ok/failed counters
feed the universe_diagnostics journal event so blindness becomes a
measurable, alertable condition instead of stderr noise.
