"""Structured investment-memo schema for long-horizon research.

The memo is the spine of the long-horizon fundamental strategy: every deep
research pass produces one, every position links back to one, and every sell
rule and monitoring check reads from one. Memos are also the system's training
signal — a memo written at entry with explicit falsifiable predictions, then
*resolved* against the realized outcome months later, is a clean supervised
example of good or bad reasoning.

Design decisions encoded here:

- **One schema, two thesis types.** A shared spine plus a ``thesis_type``
  discriminator with a type-specific block. A *value* thesis is anchored on
  earning power and monitored against quarterly fundamentals; an *event*
  thesis is anchored on a forced-seller mechanism and monitored against hard
  calendar dates. Everything downstream (monitoring cadence, sizing caps,
  outcome analysis) dispatches on ``thesis_type``, so it lives in one queryable
  corpus rather than two schemas.

- **Falsifiers are machine-checkable where possible.** A falsifier with
  ``metric``/``operator``/``threshold`` set can be evaluated mechanically by
  the monitoring loop; prose-only falsifiers require an LLM pass. Writing them
  down at entry is what makes the "thesis violation" sell rule enforceable.

- **Scenario probabilities are for calibration, NOT sizing.** LLM-stated
  probabilities are uncalibrated; sizing uses conviction tiers. Scenarios are
  recorded so that, once enough memos have resolved, stated probabilities can
  be compared against realized frequencies — only then may they inform sizing.

These are Pydantic models so agents can emit a memo directly through the
``with_structured_output`` path in ``agents/utils/structured.py``.
