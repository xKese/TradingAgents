# opened lazily inside `wait_for_callback`, which only ever runs on the
# worker loop, and only when the SDK decides a fresh grant is required — i.e.
# never in the default unit-test suite, which fakes out the transport before
# any real `auth_flow` executes. It is exercised for real only by the opt-in
# live tests (Task 6).
#
# A fixed localhost port is used rather than an OS-assigned ephemeral one so
# that the redirect_uri baked into the OAuth client metadata (built once, at
# provider-construction time) doesn't need to know about a socket that isn't
# bound until later. Dynamic client registration means no external

# repeatedly on a stored-but-idle loop) runs each call in a *new* Task, so a
# transport/session entered under one Task cannot be used from another —
# anyio raises. The fix is structural: own exactly one event loop on one
# background thread for the client's entire lifetime, and always schedule
# coroutines onto that same loop via `run_coroutine_threadsafe`, so every
# coroutine (session open in Task 2, and every tool call) runs as a Task on
# the *same* loop, in the *same* thread, satisfying anyio's task affinity.


class _AsyncWorker:

class RealRobinhoodMCPClient:
    """Concrete MCP client. Handles token load/refresh + OAuth on first run.

    Construction is side-effect-free (no network, no filesystem writes) so
    factories can build one at import time; the OAuth flow and MCP session
    are established lazily on the first call that needs them, via connect().

    SDK note (mcp==1.28.1): the installed `mcp` Python SDK is async-only —
    `mcp.client.session.ClientSession.call_tool` is a coroutine, and the
    transports (`mcp.client.streamable_http.streamablehttp_client`,
    `sse_client`, etc.) are async context managers that must be entered
    before a session can be used. There is no sync ClientSession in this
    SDK version.

    This class exposes the RobinhoodMCPClient Protocol's *sync* methods, so
    each protocol method bridges into the SDK via `_call_tool`. The bridge is
    a long-lived `_AsyncWorker`: one daemon thread owns one asyncio event
    loop for this client's entire lifetime, and every coroutine (session
    open, every tool call) is scheduled onto that same loop via
    `asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe`. This is required because the SDK's
    transports use anyio cancel scopes bound to the asyncio Task that entered
    them — a per-call `asyncio.run(...)` (or repeated `run_until_complete` on
    an otherwise-idle stored loop) creates a new Task each time, so a
    transport/session entered in one call can't be reused from the next.
    Routing every call through the same worker thread's loop keeps it all on
    one Task-affine loop. See `_AsyncWorker` for the mechanics.

    `connect()`/`close()` and Task affinity: it is not enough for the
    transport/session to merely run on the worker's *loop* — anyio's cancel
    scopes additionally require the CM that entered a scope to be *exited by
    that same asyncio Task*. An earlier version of this class violated that:
    `connect()` submitted one coroutine that entered the CMs and returned
    (ending its Task), and `close()` later submitted a *second*, different
    coroutine to exit them — anyio raises `RuntimeError("Attempted to exit
    cancel scope in a different task than it was entered in")` in that
    shape, which isn't even a `MCPUnavailable`/`Exception`-shaped failure the
    rest of the code was prepared to suppress, so `close()` could return
    without ever reaching `self._worker.stop()` (a leaked daemon thread).

    The fix: `_serve()` is one coroutine that owns the entire connection
    lifetime — enter through exit — on a single long-lived Task, spawned via
    `_AsyncWorker.spawn()` (fire-and-forget; `connect()` does not block on
    its result). It enters `streamablehttp_client` (auth=`OAuthClientProvider`,
    backed by `_FileTokenStorage`) and `ClientSession`, calls `initialize()`,
    publishes `self._session` and unblocks the waiting `connect()` call via a
    `threading.Event`, then blocks itself — on that SAME Task — on an
    `asyncio.Event` until `close()` signals it (via `call_soon_threadsafe`,
    since the event's waiters are Futures bound to the worker loop's
    thread). Only then do the CMs exit, still on the Task that entered them.
    OAuth itself (browser flow on first run, cached token thereafter) is
    handled transparently by `OAuthClientProvider`, not by manual code here —
    see `_LocalhostOAuthCallback`.

        — fire-and-hold, not blocking on the coroutine's result) and waits,
        on a `threading.Event`, for `_serve()` to signal either "session
        live" or "failed". See `_serve`'s docstring for why the whole
        connection lifetime must run on one Task.

        `OAuthClientProvider`'s `redirect_handler`/`callback_handler` (see
        `_LocalhostOAuthCallback`) run the browser-based authorization-code
        grant transparently, but only if the cached token in
        `_FileTokenStorage` is absent/unrefreshable — there is no separate
        manual flow.

        Any transport/handshake failure (auth error, connection refused,
        timeout, a rejected `initialize()`) is mapped to `MCPUnavailable`; a
        connect that never signals readiness within `connect_timeout` cancels
        the `_serve()` Task and also raises `MCPUnavailable`. Either way, no
        connection is leaked: `_serve`'s `except BaseException`/`finally`
        (Finding 2) guarantee cleanup runs even on that cancellation.

        Idempotent: a second call while already connected is a no-op.
